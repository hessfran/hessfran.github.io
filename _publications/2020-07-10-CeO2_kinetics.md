Abstract
--------
Deactivation of CeO<sub>2</sub>-based catalysts in the HCl oxidation reaction proceeds via selective bulk chlorination of the active CeO<sub>2</sub> component to form CeCl<sub>3</sub>×nH<sub>2</sub>O. We study the reactivation of two bulk-chlorinated CeO<sub>2</sub>-based Deacon catalysts by oxygen treatment at 430°C, namely pure CeO<sub>2</sub> and 20 mol% of CeO<sub>2</sub> supported on preformed ZrO<sub>2</sub> particles (20CeO<sub>2</sub>@ZrO<sub>2</sub>), with a dedicated experiment. In the flow reactor setup we determine in situ the degree of chlorination of the catalyst by quantifying downstream with in-situ UV-Vis spectroscopy the total amount of chlorine in the catalyst that is exchanged by reoxidation at 430°C. The activity of deactivated 20CeO<sub>2</sub>@ZrO<sub>2</sub> can be fully restored by oxygen exposure at 430°C, while that of pure CeO<sub>2</sub> declines steadily. Since the UV-Vis analytics is fast and sensitive, we can follow the kinetics of reoxidation. To rationalize the observed kinetics, we develop a modified Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model based on a nucleation-and-growth approach for the reoxidation of the catalyst starting from the chlorinated phase. The fast reoxidation kinetics of chlorinated 20CeO<sub>2</sub>@ZrO<sub>2</sub> is traced to a fast nucleation rate.

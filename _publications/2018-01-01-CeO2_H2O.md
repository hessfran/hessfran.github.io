Highlights
----------
* Deacon process: Deactivation of CeO<sub>2</sub> catalyst proceeds through bulk chlorination.
* Reaction temperatures above 390 Â°C and little water (1%) in the reaction feed stabilize CeO<sub>2</sub> against bulk-chlorination.
* Chlorination of the CeO<sub>2</sub> catalyst start at the inlet and propagates through the catalyst bed.
